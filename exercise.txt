   
1.	Write a Python program to loop through all the elements in a list 
  
Ex:   
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6] Output:  
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
 
  
2.	Write a Python program where you will ask the users to insert elements in a list  
 
3.	Write a Python program to remove all the odd index value from a list and only even index elements should remain 
  
Ex:   
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,”a”] 
Output: [1,3,5,7] 
   
4.	Write a Python program to sum and multiply all the items in a list 
Ex:  
Input: [1,2,3,4] 
Output: sum: -10 
              Product: -24 
  
5.	Write a Python program to get the maximum and minimum numbers from a list 
Ex:  
Input: [8,4,11,7,90] 
Output: max: - 90 
             Min: - 4 
  
  
6.	Write a Python program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements.  
 
Ex:  
Input: ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Yellow'] 
 
Output: ['Green', 'White', 'Black'] 
  
7.	Write a Python program to convert a list of characters into a string 
 
8.	Write a Python program to compute average of given lists. 
 
9.	Write a Python program to count integer in a given mixed list.   
 
 
Ex:  
 
Input: [10, “a”,2,3,5.5,1.34,” Abc”,” rt”] Output: Number of integers in the list: 
              5 
 
 
10.	Write a Python program to reverse the list   
11.	Write a Python program convert a given string to a tuple Ex: 
Input: “python1.2” 
Output: (“p”,” y”,”t”,”h”,” o”,” n”,”1”,”.”,”2”)
